# 2DRPG V2
A (second) prototype 2D text-adventure RPG.

I have two prototypes for this type of game. The less complete & on fire one is [2DRPG](https://github.com/SkyMocha/2DRPG).

This prototype uses the Godot game engine with GDScript as the language.

An overview of both prototypes as well as video demos & screenshots can be found on my website [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/RPG/).

## Overview

The project's main goal was to create a frame-work to make creating a text-based RPG adventure game easier.

To do this, I created a formatted .txt "language" using GDScript to parse it and display it in the Godot engine. 

This meant that editing levels would be entirely done within a .txt file that could be downloaded off a platform like Google Docs. Any new features (ie. music or items) would be created within the GDScript parser, so a game writer would NEVER need to code to work on the game.

This .txt file constitutes an entire level with multiple branching paths.

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)

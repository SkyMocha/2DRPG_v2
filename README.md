# 2DRPG V2
A (second) prototype 2D text-adventure RPG.

I have two prototypes for this type of game. The less complete & on fire one is [2DRPG](https://github.com/SkyMocha/2DRPG).

This prototype uses the Godot game engine with GDScript as the language.

An overview of both prototypes as well as video demos & screenshots can be found on my website [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/RPG/).

## Overview

The project's main goal was to create a frame-work to make creating a text-based RPG adventure game easier.

To do this, I created a formatted .txt "language" using GDScript to parse it and display it in the Godot engine. 

This meant that editing levels would be entirely done within a .txt file that could be downloaded off a platform like Google Docs. Any new features (ie. music or items) would be created within the GDScript parser, so a game writer would NEVER need to code to work on the game.

This .txt file constitutes an entire level with multiple branching paths.

Other improvements over the previous version are all graphical. Type-writer sounds as text goes on screen, ambient noise based on the current line, and even voice acting capabilities for my very amaetur voice acting skills!

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)

.... You are surrounded by a violent darkness; a crushing pressure from above. You inhale, and salt water fills your lungs causing you to cough violently, bringing further more water into your body. [*rise*]
..... Your body slowly rises up, with little effort from you the water swoops you up to the surface, you look around as the sounds of the sea and pouring rain pound against your ears. You look around and there is nothing but sea around you. [*close your eyes, accepting your fate stranded at sea*]
...... . . . [". . ."]
....... You blink, coughing as you are jarred awake and shoot into a straight-up position. Continuing to cough water out of your lungs, you blink, remembering that just a moment ago you were stranded at sea. The sand beneath your body is coarse, and you are wearing soaked and tattered pants and a nearly torn shirt. Your bare feet move around the coarse sand, as you continue coughing out water, slowly less and less escaping your lungs. The rain continues hitting against your body. Shelter would be a prudent thing to look for as you shiver from the cold. [*get up*]
........ Getting up, you look around. On one side of you is a seemingly never-ending sea, and on the other is a plateau that seems climb-able. Moving one foot in front of the other, you reach the plateau. [*climb*] -a(s)
......... Climbing the plateau, putting one foot infront of the other, and occasionally reaching beyond what you believe your body can accomplish, you make it to the top. With only some minor scratches, cuts, and bruises, you look back at the ever-expanding sea you came from. A lot of questions plague your mind, but to some extent there is no purpose in asking questions now, questions will get you nowhere, only putting one foot infront of the other in the hopes of coming across something will. [*walk, one foot infront of the other, step by step*]
.......... You continue walking, looking around you at the trees seemingly coming out of desolate land. The ground beneath you is rough, consisting of mud, gravel and stone. As you walk your feet sink into the mud, step by step, and the little stones occasionally graze against your feet. It's not painful, but you are uncomfortable, and a bad feeling courses through your body as the rain hits hard against your tattered shirt. After maybe minutes, maybe hours, you see stretching out of the ground a edifice. [*look up*]
........... Having looked down the majority of this journey, raising your eyes you see that this edifice, some sort of tower, stretches on into the dark and bleak sky. Past the clouds, there is no telling how tall this tower is, even at the long distance you currently stand from it. How this tower exists, why it seems to stretch into infinity, and what it contains are all questions swimming in your head. However, one thing is certain, there is only one way to find out, and you have hope that finding out will be a step forward into these mysterious circumstances you find yourself in. [*move forward*]
............ Venturing forward, moving one foot at a time, you feel your body beginning to fatigue. Cold and tired, you look forward to finding refuge in this tower. As the base of the tower comes into view, you blink against the water running over your eyes to see a mysterious figure. Too far to see who, or what, it is, you continue. [Forward.]
............. Coming closer, you see a seemingly black-cloaked figure. Their cloak and robes are longer than their medium frame, reaching into the ground, stained by mud and gravel. It is impossible to gauge them, as they have the mask of a crow, much like the plague doctors of the 1600's. Before you are able to call out to them... they speak. \n\nFigure: "Good evening, morning, and afternoon, visitor." \nNoticing the confused expression across your face, they continue before you have a chance to collect your thoughts and respond. \nFigure: "This is the tower, the only source of refuge on this island, and in this world. Many call it home. You seem to be new here, I am the gatekeeper to this refuge, in this ever-dim world." ["Ever dim world?"(dl)|"Evening, morning, and afternoon?"(dl)|". . ."(dl)] -a(vo:360)
.............. You: "Ah, but before I get to anything, your name?" [". . . My name?"]
............... You say this, your voice coming out as hoarse, not having spoken in who knows how long. You start thinking, "my name?" Your mind and voice goes blank, "my name?"... You don't know your name. \n\nYou: "I-" \nGatekeeper: "Don't know? I see, truly an outsider to this world." \nBefore you have a chance to truly comprehend what they are saying, they continue. \nGatekeeper: "Well, welcome visitor, and good evening, morning, and afternoon." ["Visitor...? Evening... afternoon.. morning?"]
................ Gatekeeper: "As I say, good evening, morning, and afternoon. For time has no relevance, for the rain continues to pour, and the sky remains obscure. You are a visitor here, nothing more, nothing less, and therefore you shall be labeled as such." ["Oh..."]
................. Gatekeeper: "Well, it would be rude to leave you out here, lets chat inside." \nThe Gatekeeper gestures, and begins walking inside. [*follow after him*]
.................. Walking inside after the Gatekeeper, you glance at the spacious room that must act as somewhat of an entrance into this tower. Seemingly more spacious on the inside than the outside, you continue looking at this dimly lit room just bright enough to see. Your eyes move back down to eye level, and you glance around, the Gatekeeper no longer able to be found. The door behind you is closed, not just closed, but somehow it seems more so an affix to the wall than an actual functional entryway. Somehow you know you are stuck here, with your only option to continue upwards. [*take a deep breathe, letting the air go in, course through you, and go out*(./foyer/.)]
